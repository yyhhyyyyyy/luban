# Persistence

This document describes what is durable (server-side) and what is UI-only (browser-side).

## Durable (server-side)

### SQLite

- SQLite is the durable store for projects/workspaces and conversation history.
- Migrations are applied via `PRAGMA user_version` in `crates/luban_backend/src/sqlite_store.rs`.
- Domain <-> persisted mapping is centralized in `crates/luban_domain/src/persistence.rs`.

### App settings (durable preferences)

Luban persists a small set of app-level preferences in SQLite so they survive restarts and can be
shared across multiple instances that point at the same database.

Currently persisted (non-exhaustive):

- Appearance:
  - theme (`light`/`dark`/`system`)
  - fonts (UI/chat/code/terminal)
- Agent defaults:
  - `agent_default_model_id`
  - `agent_default_thinking_effort`
- Workspace UX state:
  - `last_open_workspace_id`
  - workspace thread tabs (open/archived/active)
  - chat scroll position and scroll anchor
  - unread completion markers

Notes:

- These preferences are persisted through `Effect::SaveAppState`.
- Storage is implemented via `app_settings` (integer) and `app_settings_text` (string) tables.
- Persistence of UI-related fields can be disabled by constructing the store with
  `SqliteStoreOptions { persist_ui_state: false }` (primarily for tests).

### Workspace-scoped context storage

Attachments are stored on disk under a workspace-scoped directory:

```
~/luban/conversations/<project_slug>/<workspace_name>/context/
  blobs/
    <blake3>.<ext>
    <blake3>.thumb.<ext>
```

- Blobs are content-addressed (BLAKE3).
- Attachments are referenced from messages as structured `AttachmentRef`s; the web UI does not embed
  filesystem paths in message text.

## UI-only (browser-side)

The web UI is a single-page app. State that is purely presentational or device-specific lives in
browser `localStorage` and is not required to be durable across machines.

Current keys:

- `luban:active_workspace_id`
- `luban:ui:right_sidebar_open`
- `luban:ui:view_mode`
- `luban:ui:sidebar_width_px`
- `luban:ui:right_sidebar_width_px`
- `luban:ui:global_zoom` (Tauri only)
- `luban:active_thread_id:<workspace_id>`
- `luban:draft:<workspace_id>:<thread_id>`
- `luban:follow_tail:<workspace_id>:<thread_id>`

Notes:

- Theme and appearance fonts are persisted in SQLite and should not depend on these keys.
  The web theme implementation may still write a cache key in `localStorage` via `next-themes`,
  but the durable source of truth is the server `AppSnapshot`.

## Non-goals

- Cross-device sync.
- Multi-user / concurrent writers.


## Verification plan (for implementation)

### Unit tests

- Migration application:
  - start from an empty DB and reach `LATEST`
  - start from an older `user_version` and upgrade
- Persistence roundtrip:
  - create projects/workspaces, persist, reload, compare the durable fields
- Conversation append/load:
  - append a sequence of `ConversationEntry`s, reload, verify ordering and deduplication behavior for Codex items
- Failure handling:
  - invalid DB path, locked DB, corrupt DB file (surface error, keep UI responsive)

### Manual steps

1. Launch the app and ensure it loads without UI stalls.
2. Add a project and create a workspace.
3. Send a message and wait for a few streamed entries.
4. Restart the app.
5. Verify the project/workspace list is restored.
6. Open the workspace and verify conversation history loads from SQLite.
7. Archive a workspace, restart, verify it remains archived.
