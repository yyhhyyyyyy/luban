# Release CI

This repository ships release artifacts via GitHub Actions when a tag is pushed.

## What the workflow does

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

- Trigger
  - `push` to tags matching `v*` (packages + uploads)
  - `pull_request` to `main` will run only when `justfile` or `.github/workflows/release.yml` changes (package test; no uploads)
- Outputs
  - Builds and uploads artifacts to Cloudflare R2 (used by `releases.luban.dev`)
  - Publishes a merged `latest.json` after all platform uploads succeed

Current targets:

- `darwin-universal`
- `linux-x86_64`
- `windows-x86_64`
- `linux-aarch64`
- `windows-aarch64`

## 1Password-based secrets

The workflow authenticates to 1Password using a service account token, then uses `op inject` to
materialize `.env` from `.env.example` before running `just` recipes.

### GitHub Secrets (required)

- `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`
  - A 1Password service account token with access to the vault/items referenced below.
- `LUBAN_VAULT`
  - Vault name used by `.env.example`.

Note: `.env.example` contains `op://...` references and is the only place where secret reference
paths are configured.

### GitHub Variables (optional)
None.

## Artifacts directory

Packaging outputs are written under `dist/` (gitignored) by default.

## Releasing

Recommended: create and push a tag:

1. Ensure `LUBAN_VAULT` and `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` are configured.
2. Create a tag like `v0.1.5+20260127` and push it (tags containing `-` are rejected).
3. Wait for the `Release` workflow to finish.
4. Verify `latest.json` and the uploaded artifacts on `releases.luban.dev`.

Note: Repository versions (`Cargo.toml`, `web/package.json`, `crates/luban_tauri/tauri.conf.json`) are placeholders. Release builds derive the user-visible version from the git tag and inject it at build time.

## Nightly patch releases

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/nightly-release.yml`

This workflow runs daily (03:00 UTC) and:

- Checks whether `main` has new commits since the latest release tag.
- If yes, bumps the patch version and appends a build metadata suffix `+YYYYMMDD`.
- Creates an annotated tag `v<version>` and a GitHub release.
- The existing `Release` workflow will then package and upload artifacts when the tag is pushed.

Notes:

- Build date uses UTC by default. Override via workflow dispatch input `build_date` (or `BUILD_DATE=YYYYMMDD`) if needed.
- If `Cargo.toml` is already ahead of the latest tag (e.g. a manual version bump), the workflow will release that version (with a build suffix) instead of bumping patch again.
